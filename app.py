# print all number from 1 to 10

names = ["bran", "ana", "joe", "nate"]

# names is an iratable. Can get indiviual items. every item in names Im going to refer to as name and do something with it inside this for loop. name is for loop is a word for me to make sense if what is in the names list(actual name). Change name to x and will print the same

# interpoltion
for name in names:
    print(f"a name from the list is {name}")
